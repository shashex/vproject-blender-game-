The video game I want to develop is based on free models I found on the internet and are all compatible with open source licenses.

It is a game where players will face a multitude of threatening aliens, and the game allows also two players simultaneously to help each other.

This is also a project for a game based on the blender game engine, in order to relize a book for teaching how to develop a game in Blender from the beginning.
